# picross
A Scala based implementation of the puzzle game Picross

## What is this project?

This is a small side project of mine to re-visit Scala after
some time I spent focusing on my college studies. Since Scala 3 was
released by the time I graduated, I wanted to work on a project that
used Scala 3 and also learn more about UI rendering libraries that
Scala has to offer.

Picross is a classic puzzle game that I was interested in recently,
and I wanted to learn more about it by both implementing the game
and verifying that my project conforms to the Picross game rules.

This project will be developed *purely* in Scala, but libraries like
ScalaFX and Scala.js will be used to render desktop and web UIs to play
the game.
